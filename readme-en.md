# **Lifted-ElGamal**

C++ Library for the Lifted-ElGamal Cryptosystem

# Summary
This library provides for the implementation of the lifted-ElGamal cryptosystem with additively homomorphic properties [1] and the non-interactive zero knowledge proof for restricting message space [2].

# List of Supported CPUs and Operating Systems

* Intel 64-bit Core 2 Duo or newer Intel 64-bit CPUs
* 64-bit Windows 7 or newer
* 64-bit Linux (tested on ubuntu 13.10)
* Windows 7 + Cygwin 6.1 (32-bit) or newer

# List of Supported Compilers and Prerequisite Tools
* Visual Studio 2012 + MPIR 2.6.0 on Windows 7
* gcc 4.8.1 + OpenSSL 1.0.1e + GMP 5.1.2

# Installation Requirements

Create a working directory (e.g., work) and clone the following repositories.

       mkdir work
       cd work
       git clone git://github.com/aistcrypt/Lifted-ElGamal.git
       git clone git://github.com/herumi/xbyak.git
       git clone git://github.com/herumi/mie.git
       git clone git://github.com/herumi/cybozulib.git
       git clone git://github.com/herumi/cybozulib_ext.git

* Cybozulib_ext is a prerequisite for running OpenSSL and GMP on VC (Visual C++).
* Xbyak is a prerequisite for optimizing the operations in the finite field on Intel CPUs.
* OpenSSL and libgmp-dev are available via apt-get (or other similar commands) if using Linux.

# Installation
Linux (64-bit) or Cygin (32-bit):

      cd lifted-elgamal
      make -j # for debug
      make -j RELEASE=1 # for release
      make -j RELEASE=1 USE_TCMALLOC=1

* use tcmalloc (optimal) for Linux; sudo apt-get install libgoogle-perftools-dev

Windows (64-bit):

      # for Visual Studio 2012
      open lifted-elgamal/elgamal.sln and build it
      # for Visual Studio 2013
      open lifted-elgamal/elgamal12.sln and build it

Linux (32-bit):

      make -j BIT=32 # for debug
      make -j BIT=32 RELEASE=1 # for release

# Prerequisite Files and Libraries for Running Your Application

Linux:
	* OpenSSL
	* GMP (libgmp-dev)

Windows:
	* bin/libeay32.dll, bin/ssleay32.dll
